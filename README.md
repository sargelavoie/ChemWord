# ChemWord
An application to automate molecule numbering in manuscript writing

## Project status
The project is looking at skilled contributor

## Description
Scientific articles and thesis in organic chemistry usually number molecules with bold font. When these manuscript are drafted, it is not rare one have to add, delete or change the numbers. This process is frustrating since all document and the associate figures need to be update. This tool automate the process by using hidden variables in word-processor application than can be cross-referenced. Any change in the variable can automatically trigger the update of the number though all document.

## Installation
There is no installation needed. The application is completely portable, and all the data are saved in the word-processing document.

For now, the only compatible applications are Microsoft Word and Chemdraw. A broader range of compatible applications will be included, as long someone join this coding effort.
